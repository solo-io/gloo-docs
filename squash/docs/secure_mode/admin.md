## Secure Mode Administration

- This guide shows you how to set up and manage Squash's secure mode.

## Introduction

- Secure Mode is designed to allow you to apply regular Kubernetes RBAC configurations to Squash debugging activities.
- **Proper configuration is required for Secure Mode to be secure**.
- Fortunately, configuration is easy. This guide outlines the best practices for configuring Secure Mode. Ultimately, you are responsible for your cluster's security, so please apply these recommendations as is appropriate to your use case.

## Motivation

- Secure Mode is recommended for multi-user clusters.
- Reasons to use Secure Mode:
  - Prevent users from unexpectedly halting your process in a debug state.
  - Prevent malicious exploitation of the Plank pods' `SYS_PTRACE` capabilities.
  - Prevent malicious exploitation of the Squash pod's `Privileged` security context.

## Deploy Squash

### Quick Start

- To "kick the tires" on Squash's Secure Mode, you can install it with a single command: `squashctl deploy squash`.
- This creates all the resources needed to start using Secure Mode:
  - Creates `squash-debugger` namespace.
  - Creates a Service Account with the minimal required permissions.
  - Deploys Squash.

### Formal Deployment

- For shared cluster Squash usage, you should manage your squash deployment through your conventional workflow.
- Resources required by Squash include:
  - Deployments - Squash
  - Service Accounts - Squash, Plank
  - Cluster Roles - Squash, Plank
  - Cluster Role Bindings - Squash, Plank
- For details, see a reference configuration for these resources below.

## Configuration requirements for preventing undesired debug activities

- Suggestion: do not authorize your users to `kubectl exec` into the namespace that stores the `squash` and `plank` pods.

```yaml
# Reference: pod exec Policy Rule
# DO NOT enable this permission for the squash-debugger namespace
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default # DO NOT enable this permission for the squash-debugger namespace
  name: pod-exec
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods/exec"] # DO NOT enable this permission for the squash-debugger namespace
  verbs: ["create"]
```

## Reference configuration

- Note: This is a reference configuration for the resources required by Squash.
- Note: A priority for our implementation of Secure Mode is minimizing permissions granted to Squash and Plank pods. Our roadmap includes upcoming features that will further reduce the permissions needed by Squash and Plank. These future changes are cited below. We will update these reference configurations as their needs change.

### Managed resources

- These are the resources you need to configure and manage yourself.

#### Deployment - Squash

### Implicit Resources

- These resources are managed by Squash itself.
- Note: Squash currently has the ability to create the Service Account, Cluster Role, and Cluster Role Bindings needed by Plank pods. As noted above, this capability will be revoked in the near-term and Squash will expect them to have already been created.

#### Pod - Plank

- Note: Plank pods are created by Squash, you will not need to manage this resource but it is useful to know what it looks like.
- In this example, the is debugging a pod named "example-service1-8499d97885" in namespace "my-namespace"

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: plank
  labels:
    debug_attachment_name: example-service1-8499d97885-bgh59
    debug_attachment_namespace: my-namespace
    squash: plank
  name: planklrv4j
  namespace: squash-debugger
spec:
  containers:
  - env:
    - name: SQUASH_DEBUG_ATTACHMENT_NAMESPACE
      value: my-namespace
    - name: SQUASH_DEBUG_ATTACHMENT_NAME
