# Solo Docs

Consolidated repo for building and deploying Solo docs. 

## Gloo

The consolidated open source and enterprise Gloo docs are in the `gloo` directory. The content of this directory includes:

* Autogenerated API reference docs, produced during code generation for Gloo based on the protocol buffer definitions. These 
live in the `docs/v1` directory, and new API docs are pushed here every time Gloo open source or enterprise are released. The 
files in this directory should not be modified manually. 
* Autogenerated CLI reference docs, produced for Gloo based on the CLI implementation. These live in the `docs/cli` directory, and
new CLI docs are pushed here every time Gloo open source or enterprise are released. These files should also not be modified manually. 
* Manually created docs, static content, and theme overrides. 

## Sqoop

The Sqoop docs are in the `sqoop` directory. 

# Building

To build any of these docs sites locally:
* Clone the repo
* Install `hugo` (currently the CI build uses Hugo 0.54)
* Navigate to the desired product directory and run `make serve-site`. 

This will build the site and host it by default on `localhost:1313`.

# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the docs. Please test changes locally, and then open a pull request on this repo. The 
pull request must be reviewed and approved by a member of Solo. 

# Version management and publishing. 

Currently, this repo contains the consolidated docs for the latest versions of Gloo and Sqoop. When a PR merges into master, the docs are automatically deployed to `gloo.solo.io` and `sqoop.solo.io`.
