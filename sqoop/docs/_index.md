### What is Sqoop?

Sqoop (formerly QLoo) is a GraphQL Server built on top of [Gloo](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo) and the [Envoy Proxy](https://envoyproxy.io).

Sqoop leverages Gloo's function registry and Envoy's advanced HTTP routing features to provide a GraphQL frontend
for REST/gRPC applications and serverless functions. Sqoop routes requests to data sources via Envoy, leveraging
Envoy [HTTP filters](https://envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/http_filters.html)
for security, load balancing, and [more](https://gloo.solo.io/#features).

## Workflow with Sqoop

* Register or Discovery API Endpoints and Serverless Functions with Gloo
* Upload a GraphQL schema
* Connect Functions to your Schema's fields in a Sqoop ResolverMap

## Features

* **Codeless GraphQL API**: Instantly deploy a GraphQL server and connect it to your data sources with configuration,
zero code required.
* **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Load balance traffic across multiple data sources.
* **Health Checks**: Active and passive monitoring of your data sources.
* **OpenTracing**: Monitor GraphQL requests using the well-supported OpenTracing standard
* **Monitoring**: Export HTTP metrics to Prometheus or Statsd
* **Client SSL**: Communicate with Data Sources using TLS encryption
* **Declarative API**: Sqoop features a declarative YAML-based API; store your configuration as code and commit it with your projects.
* **Scalability**: Sqoop scales independently of your data sources and scales infinitely.
* **Performance**: Sqoop leverages Envoy for its high network performance and low footprint.
* **Plugins**: Sqoop leverage's [Gloo's plugin ecosystem](https://gloo.solo.io/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/plugins.proto.sk/) to enable extending the types
of data sources Sqoop can connect to.
* **JSON-to-gRPC transcoding**: Connect GraphQL JSON clients to gRPC data sources.

**Service Discovery**:

* Kubernetes
* OpenShift
* HashiCorp Stack (Vault, Consul, Nomad)
* Cloud Foundry

**Function Discovery**:

* AWS Lambda
* Microsoft Azure Functions
* Google Cloud Platform Functions
* Fission
* OpenFaaS
* ProjectFn
* Swagger/REST
* gRPC

### Thanks

**Sqoop** would not be possible without the valuable open-source work of projects in the community. We would like to extend
a special thank-you to [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) and [gqlgen](https://github.com/vektah/gqlgen) server library.
