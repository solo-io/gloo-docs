 1. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
 2. [sqoopctl](https://github.com/solo-io/sqoop/releases)

#### Install

 Run the following command to download the config files necessary for docker-compose to a local directory:

```bash
glooctl install docker [path]
```


`cd` to this directory to begin working with Sqoop.


#### Running Sqoop

Start Sqoop by simply running `docker-compose up`

```bash
cd [folder]

docker-compose up
```
## Installing without `sqoopctl`

 Initialize the storage directories and `sqoopctl` configuration for Sqoop:
