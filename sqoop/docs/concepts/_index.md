### What is Sqoop?

Sqoop is a GraphQL Server built on top of [Gloo](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo) and the [Envoy Proxy](https://envoyproxy.io).

Sqoop leverages Gloo's function registry and Envoy's advanced HTTP routing features to provide a GraphQL frontend
for REST/gRPC applications and serverless functions. Sqoop routes requests to data sources via Envoy, leveraging 
Envoy [HTTP filters](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/config/filter/filter.html?highlight=http%20filter) 
for security, load balancing, and more.

Sqoop makes HTTP requests through Gloo to invoke service endpoints and serverless functions through Gloo. Sqoop users
import their GraphQL Schemas and attach **Gloo functions** to the fields of their schemas. Sqoop uses Gloo functions to generate
its own resolvers, allowing users to get a fully-functional GraphQL frontend for their serverless functions and services 
without writing any code. This is why we call Sqoop the **Codeless GraphQL Server**.


### Using Sqoop

Compared to typical GraphQL implementations, Sqoop's configuration API is quite simple. Configuration takes two steps:

0. Importing GraphQL schemas into Sqoop (done most easily via `sqoopctl`).
0. Attaching **Gloo functions** to schema fields by defining [resolvers](resolvers) in a [ResolverMap](api_objects). 

Sqoop will execute GraphQL queries (and mutations) via port `:9090` by default.
