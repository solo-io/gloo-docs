description: Guidelines and best practices for developing and configuring Go plugins to extend Gloo's ext auth server
---

## Intro
In the [**Plugin Auth** guide]({{< ref "gloo_routing/virtual_services/security/plugin_auth" >}}) we showed how 
easy it is to extend Gloo with custom authentication logic using Go plugins. That guide uses a 
[plugin](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples/tree/master/plugins/required_header) that has already been 
built and published, and primarily focuses on giving an overview of the plugin development workflow.

In this guide, we will get our hands dirty and dig into the nitty-gritty details of how to write, test, build, and 
publish your external auth plugins.

#### Before you start
This guide will make frequent references to the code contained in our 
[Ext Auth Plugin examples](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples) GitHub repository. In addition to the sample 
plugin implementation, the repository contains useful tools to verify whether your plugin is compatible with a certain 
version of GlooE. Given the [constraints imposed by Go plugins](#build-helper-tools), these utilities will make your life 
significantly easier.

{{% notice note %}}
We recommend that you fork the example repository and use it as a starting point to develop your plugins.

#### Development workflow overview
In the [**Plugin Auth** guide]({{< ref "gloo_routing/virtual_services/security/plugin_auth#development-workflow-overview" >}}) 
we gave a high-level description of the steps required to extend Gloo with your own plugins:

1. Write a plugin and publish it as a `docker image` which, when run, copies the compiled plugin file to a 
predefined directory.
2. Configure Gloo to load the plugin by running the image as an `initContainer` on the `extauth` deployment. This can be 
done by rendering the Gloo Helm chart with some value overrides or by modifying the Gloo installation manifest manually.
3. Reference your plugin in your Virtual Services for it to be invoked for requests matching particular virtual hosts or 
routes.

In the following sections we will see each one of them in greater detail.

## Building and publishing and auth plugin
In this section we will see how to develop an auth plugin and distribute it the format that Gloo expects.

### API overview
When developing external auth plugins, there are two interfaces we need to be familiar with. They are both defined 
[here](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/blob/master/api/interface.go).

##### ExtAuthPlugin
Gloo expects auth plugins to implement the 
[ExtAuthPlugin](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/blob/master/api/interface.go#L41) interface.

```go
type ExtAuthPlugin interface {
	NewConfigInstance(ctx context.Context) (configInstance interface{}, err error)
	GetAuthService(ctx context.Context, configInstance interface{}) (AuthService, error)
}
```

Objects that implement this interface are used as factories for authentication service instances. After Gloo detects a 
reference to your plugin on a Virtual Service and loads it, it will call the `NewConfigInstance` function to get an 
object to deserialize the plugin configuration into. 

{{% notice warning %}}
The object returned by the `NewConfigInstance` function **MUST** be a pointer type.
{{% /notice %}}

Let's see an example to understand this better. If your plugin configuration looks like this:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=17-22" >}}
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: test-auth
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  virtualHost:
    domains: {} # omitted for brevity
    routes: {} # omitted for brevity
    virtualHostPlugins:
      extensions:
        configs:
          extauth:
            plugin_auth:
              plugins:
              - name: my-plugin
                plugin_file_name: MyPlugin.so
                exported_symbol_name: Plugin
                config:
                  some_key: value-1
                  some_struct:
                    another_key: value-2
{{< /highlight >}}

then `NewConfigInstance` function of your `ExtAuthPlugin` implementation should return a pointer to the following Go struct:

```go
type MyPluginConfig struct {
    SomeKey string
    SomeStruct NestedConfig
}

type NestedConfig struct {
    AnotherKey string
 }
```

Gloo will populate the struct fields with the values found on the correspondent YAML attributes.

{{% notice note %}}
You might have noticed that the `plugins` attribute in the configuration example above is an array. It is in fact 
possible to define multiple plugins on a virtual host. We'll see how [plugin chains](#plugin-chains-and-header-propagation) work later on.
{{% /notice %}}

The `GetAuthService` function will be invoked by Gloo right after this step. As its `configInstance` argument, Gloo will 
pass the object that it just populated with the values from the plugin configuration. This function must return an 
instance of the [AuthService](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/blob/master/api/interface.go#L49) interface.

##### AuthService
`AuthService` instances are responsible for authorizing individual requests. This is the interface that all of Gloo's 
out-of-the box auth implementations (basic auth, OIDC, etc.) implement as well. Your plugin is responsible for providing 
Gloo with a valid `AuthService` implementation.

```go
type AuthService interface {
	Start(ctx context.Context) error
	Authorize(ctx context.Context, request *AuthorizationRequest) (*AuthorizationResponse, error)
}
```

The `Start` function will be called once by Gloo, when the auth service is started. It is intended as a hook to perform 
initialization logic or to start auxiliary processes that span the whole lifecycle of the service.

All the functions we have just described (`NewConfigInstance`, `GetAuthService`, and `Start`) will be invoked when Gloo 
detects a new auth configuration on your Virtual Services. The `Authorize` function, on the other hand, will be invoked 
each time a request hits Gloo and matches the virtual host on which the your plugin is defined. 
The `AuthorizationResponse` that it returns will determine whether the request will be allowed or denied. 
We provide minimal responses of both types via the `AuthorizedResponse()` and `UnauthorizedResponse()` 
functions in [the same package](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/blob/master/api/interface.go#L114-L134). 
You can use them as a basis for your own responses.

#### About the AuthService lifecycle
We mentioned how `ExtAuthPlugin` implementations function as factories for `AuthService` instances. It's worth spending 
a few words on the lifecycle of `AuthService`s. You might have noticed that Gloo passes a `context.Context` to each of 
the functions we just saw. The context will live as long as the plugin configuration that generated it is valid. 
Whenever the auth configuration changes, Gloo will start new `AuthService` instances and signal the termination of the 
previous ones by cancelling the context it provided them with.

Following is the sequence of actions that Gloo performs when it detects a change in the overall auth configuration. 
Let's assume we start with a blank sheet, i.e. no plugins are configured on any of your Virtual Services.

1. Start a new cancellable `context.Context`
2. Loop over all detected plugin configurations and for each one:
    1. Load the correspondent plugin `.so` file from the `auth-plugins` directory (more info about this [later](#configuring-gloo-to-load-your-plugins))
    2. Invoke `NewConfigInstance` **passing in the context**
    3. Deserialize detected plugin config into the provided object
    4. Invoke `GetAuthService` **passing in the context** and the configuration object
    5. (if more than one plugin) Add it to the [plugin chain](#plugin-chains-and-header-propagation)
3. If an error occurred, return it and do not update the `extauth` server configuration, else continue
4. Cancel the previous `context.Context`
5. Invoke the `Start` functions on all plugins **passing in the context**
6. Apply the plugin configurations to the `extauth` server

We recommend that you tie all the goroutines that you may spawn to the provided context by watching its `Done` channel. 
This will prevent your plugin from leaking memory. You can find a great overview of `Context` and how to best use it 
in [this Go Blog post](https://blog.golang.org/context).\

#### How to make your plugin implement `ExtAuthPlugin`
Earlier in this guide we mentioned that Gloo expects auth plugins to implement the 
[ExtAuthPlugin](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/blob/master/api/interface.go#L41) interface. To understand 
what we mean by that, let's take a closer look at how Go plugins work.

The [official Go docs](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/) describe a plugin as:

>> "*a Go main package with exported functions and variables that has been built with: `go build -buildmode=plugin`*"

In order for Gloo to be able to load your plugin, the `main` package of your plugin must export a variable that 
implements the [ExtAuthPlugin](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/blob/master/api/interface.go) interface. 
This is usually a struct or a pointer to a struct (Gloo is smart enough to handle both cases). 
Gloo will use the [Lookup function](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/#Plugin.Lookup) to find the exported variable and 
assert that it in fact implements the expected interface.

You can specify the name of the variable Gloo looks for when you reference your plugin in your Virtual Services:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=5" >}}
plugin_auth:
  plugins:
  - name: my-plugin
    plugin_file_name: MyPlugin.so
    exported_symbol_name: Plugin
    config: {}
{{< /highlight >}}

See the [*Plugin Auth* guide]({{< ref "gloo_routing/virtual_services/security/plugin_auth#secure-the-virtual-service" >}}) 
for more information about the structure of this piece of configuration. 

### Build helper tools
Now that we saw how to write your plugin, it's time to look at how to build it. When working with plugins, building your 
code is not as straightforward as when working with regular Go programs. Go plugins impose a set of **pretty harsh 
constraints on your build environment** for plugins work with the program that is supposed to load them:

1. The plugin Go compiler version must exactly match the program's compiler version. For example, loading a plugin 
compiled with Go 1.12.9 will not work with a program compiled with 1.12.8. The flags provided during compilation must match 
as well.
2. Any libraries that are shared by both the plugin and the program must have their versions match *exactly*. Moreover, 
these libraries must be compiled with the same `GOPATH` value when building both the plugin and the program.
3. Both the plugins and the program need to be built with CGO_ENABLED=1. Cross compiling isn't as easy as 
`GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build` anymore.

If any of the above conditions is not met, loading the plugin will fail.

All these constraints can make plugin development pretty frustrating. This is why we provide a set of tools that are 
meant make your plugin development experience as smooth as possible. You can find these tools in our 
[Ext Auth Plugin examples](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples) GitHub repository.

{{% notice note %}}
Gloo publishes information about the environment it was built with to a Google Storage bucket. The tools in this section 
will make use of those information. You can find the information for a specific Gloo version in the following files located 
under `http://storage.googleapis.com/gloo-ee-dependencies/[GLOOE_VERSION]`:

- `Gopkg.lock`: contains the versions of all dependencies used by GlooE.
- `build_env`: values that can be used to replicate the environment the given GlooE version was built in.
- `verify-plugins-linux-amd64`: a script to verify that the plugin can be loaded by the given GlooE version.

You can get all these files by running `GLOOE_VERSION=desired_version make get-glooe-info` in our example repository.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Compare dependencies
We manage Gloo dependencies using [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep). `Dep` outputs the version of all dependencies 
for a Go package in a file named `Gopkg.lock`. If you manage the dependencies for your plugin using `dep`, we provide a 
script for comparing them with the ones for GlooE. It located at `scripts/compare_dependencies.go` and can be invoked 
via the following `make` command:

```bash
GLOOE_VERSION=desired_version make compare-deps
```

If all dependencies match, the command will exit with a zero code, else it will output the discrepancies to both stdout 
and to a file (`mismatched_dependencies.json`) and exit with code 1. Here's an example of the output in case of failure:

```json
[
  {
    "pluginDependencies": {
      "name": "go.uber.org/zap",
      "version": "v1.9.0",
      "revision": "3c4937480c32f4c13a875a1829af76c98ca3d40a"
    },
    "glooeDependencies": {
      "name": "go.uber.org/zap",
      "version": "v1.10.0",
      "revision": "27376062155ad36be76b0f12cf1572a221d3a48c"
    }
  }
]
```

If you get an error message like this, you have to manually update the dependencies in your `Gopkg.toml` file. In this 
case we would need to add the following stanza:

```toml
[[override]]
  name = "go.uber.org/zap"
  version = "=v1.10.0"
```

or, even better since the revision hash is the ultimate source of truth:

```toml
[[override]]
  name = "go.uber.org/zap"
  revision = "27376062155ad36be76b0f12cf1572a221d3a48c"
```

If you are using a different dependency management tool (e.g. Go modules), you should still be able to use the 
information in the GlooE `Gopkg.lock` file to verify that the dependencies match.
  
#### Verify compatibility script
As part of each GlooE release, we ship a script to verify whether your plugin can be loaded by that version of GlooE. 
You can find it in the aforementioned Google Cloud bucket at 
`http://storage.googleapis.com/gloo-ee-dependencies/[GLOOE_VERSION]/verify-plugins-linux-amd64`. The script accepts 
three arguments:

| Arg Name | Description | Optional |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| pluginDir | Path to a directory containing the plugin `.so` files to verify |  No |
| manifest | A .yaml file containing information required to load the plugins | No |
| debug | Set debug log level | Yes |

The `manifest` file is needed to instruct the script on how to load the plugins. It intentionally has the same format as 
the plugin configuration that you define on your Virtual Services:

```yaml
plugins:
- name: MyPlugin
  pluginFileName: Plugin.so
  exportedSymbolName: MyPlugin
- name: AnotherPlugin
  plugin_file_name: AnotherFile.so
  exported_symbol_name: AnotherSymbol
```

Here is the sample output of a successful run of the script:

```text
{"level":"info","ts":"2019-08-21T17:02:22.803Z","logger":"verify-plugins.header_value_plugin","caller":"pkg/impl.go:39","msg":"Parsed RequiredHeaderAuthService config","requiredHeader":"my-auth-header","allowedHeaderValues":["foo","bar","baz"]}
{"level":"info","ts":"2019-08-21T17:02:22.803Z","logger":"verify-plugins","caller":"plugins/loader.go:85","msg":"Successfully loaded plugin. Adding it to the plugin chain.","pluginName":"RequiredHeader"}
{"level":"info","ts":"2019-08-21T17:02:22.803Z","logger":"verify-plugins","caller":"scripts/verify_plugins.go:62","msg":"Successfully verified that plugins can be loaded by Gloo!"}
```

{{% notice note %}}
The script is compiled to run on `linux` with `amd64` architectures. We will explain how it is supposed to be used in the next section.
{{% /notice %}}
 
#### Docker file
We mentioned that the plugin must be compiled with the same `GOPATH` as Gloo. We also cannot easily cross-compile with 
`go build` because we need to run with CGO enabled. The best way to get around these constraints is to compile inside a 
container.

The example repository contains a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples/blob/master/Dockerfile),
which we include here since all of it is relevant. You can use it as a starting point for your builds. We recommend that 
you use [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) to keep the size of 
your final image to a minimum. See the comments for an explanation of each build layer:

```Dockerfile
# This stage is parametrized to replicate the same environment GlooE was built in.
# All ARGs need to be set via the docker `--build-arg` flags.
ARG GO_BUILD_IMAGE
FROM $GO_BUILD_IMAGE AS build-env

# This must contain the value of the `gcflag` build flag that Gloo was built with
ARG GC_FLAGS
# This must contain the path to the plugin verification script
ARG VERIFY_SCRIPT

# Fail if VERIFY_SCRIPT not set
# We don't have the same check GC_FLAGS as empty values are allowed
RUN if [[ ! $VERIFY_SCRIPT ]]; then echo "Required VERIFY_SCRIPT build argument not set" && exit 1; fi

# Install packaes needed for compilation
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev

# Copy the repository to the image and set it as the working directory. The GOPATH her is `/go`.
#
# You have to update the path here to the one corresponding to your repository. This is usually in the form:
# /go/src/github.com/YOUR_ORGANIZATION/PLUGIN_REPO_NAME
ADD . /go/src/github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples/
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples

# De-vendor all the dependencies and move them to the GOPATH, so they will be loaded from there.
# We need this so that the import paths for any library shared between the plugins and Gloo are the same.
#
# For example, if we were to vendor the ext-auth-plugin dependency, the ext-auth-server would load the plugin interface
# as `GLOOE_REPO/vendor/github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/api.ExtAuthPlugin`, while the plugin
# would instead implement `THIS_REPO/vendor/github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/api.ExtAuthPlugin`. These would be seen 
# by the go runtime as two different types, causing Gloo to fail.
# Also, some packages cause problems if loaded more than once. For example, loading `golang.org/x/net/trace` twice
# causes a panic (see here: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24137). By flattening the dependencies this way we
# prevent these sorts of problems.
RUN cp -a vendor/. /go/src/ && rm -rf vendor

# Build plugins with CGO enabled, passing the GC_FLAGS flags
RUN CGO_ENABLED=1 GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build -buildmode=plugin -gcflags="$GC_FLAGS" -o plugins/RequiredHeader.so plugins/required_header/plugin.go

# Run the script to verify that the plugin(s) can be loaded by Gloo
RUN chmod +x $VERIFY_SCRIPT
RUN $VERIFY_SCRIPT -pluginDir plugins -manifest plugins/plugin_manifest.yaml

# This stage builds the final image containing just the plugin .so files. It can really be any linux/amd64 image.
FROM alpine:3.10.1

# Copy compiled plugin file from previous stage
RUN mkdir /compiled-auth-plugins
COPY --from=build-env /go/src/github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples/plugins/RequiredHeader.so /compiled-auth-plugins/

# This is the command that will be executed when the container is run. 
# It has to copy the compiled plugin file(s) to a directory.
CMD cp /compiled-auth-plugins/* /auth-plugins/
```

The two `GO_BUILD_IMAGE`, `VERIFY_SCRIPT`, and `GC_FLAGS` arguments have to be passed to docker via the `--build-arg` flag(s):

```bash
docker build -t your_repo:your_tag \
    --build-arg GO_BUILD_IMAGE=<value-from-build_env-file> \
	--build-arg GC_FLAGS=<value-from-build_env-file> \
    --build-arg VERIFY_SCRIPT=<value-from-build_env-file> \
	.
```

You have to get the values for these arguments from the Google Cloud bucket. 

{{% notice note %}}
Our example repository contains a [Makefile](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples/blob/master/Makefile) 
with targets that automate these steps and can be easily modified to fit your needs. Be sure to check it out!

#### Wrapping it up
If you followed the guide to this point, you should have an image that is guaranteed to be compatible with Gloo.

The next step is to see how to set up Gloo to use your plugins.

## Configuring Gloo to load your plugins
The Gloo `extauth` server loads plugins from a directory in the file system it has access to. It is possible to 
accomplish this in different ways, but the preferred one (and the reason why we packaged the plugins as docker images 
with a `copy` entry point) is by running the plugin container(s) as `initContainer`(s) and mounting a volume shared with 
the `extauth` deployment.

In the [**Plugin Auth** guide]({{< ref "gloo_routing/virtual_services/security/plugin_auth" >}}) we saw how to do 
this [using the GlooE Helm chart]({{< ref "gloo_routing/virtual_services/security/plugin_auth#installation" >}}). 
Here we will see how to accomplish the same result by editing the raw GlooE YAML manifest.

Let's start with a basic version of the `extauth` deployment. Note that we are omitting many attributes for brevity.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: gloo
    gloo: extauth
  name: extauth
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      gloo: extauth
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        gloo: extauth
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/solo-io/extauth-ee:0.18.23
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: extauth
```

In order for the `extauth` server to load the plugin files from your images, we apply the following changes:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=22-34" >}}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: gloo
    gloo: extauth
  name: extauth
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      gloo: extauth
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        gloo: extauth
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/solo-io/extauth-ee:0.18.23
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: extauth
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /auth-plugins
          name: auth-plugins
      initContainers:
      - image: quay.io/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins:0.18.23
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: plugin-my-plugin
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /auth-plugins
          name: auth-plugins
      volumes:
      - emptyDir: {}
        name: auth-plugins
{{< /highlight >}}

A [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) volume has been added and it is mounted on 
both the `extauth` container and the plugin `initContainers` at the `/auth-plugins` path. This is the same path our 
plugin container is configured to copy the plugin files to when it is run.

{{% notice note %}}
Currently, Gloo expects to find the plugin files in the `/auth-plugins` directory. We plan to make this location configurable soon.
{{% /notice %}}

## Configuring Virtual Services to use your plugins
The [*Plugin Auth* guide]({{< ref "gloo_routing/virtual_services/security/plugin_auth#secure-the-virtual-service" >}}) 
contains a thorough explanation of how to update Virtual Service specs to use your plugins to authenticate requests. 
What it does not cover are some specific properties of *plugin chains*.

### Plugin chains and header propagation
As we saw earlier, the `plugins` element in the `plugin_auth` configuration is an array:

```yaml
virtualHostPlugins:
  extensions:
    configs:
      extauth:
        plugin_auth:
          plugins:
          - name: my-plugin
            plugin_file_name: MyPlugin.so
            exported_symbol_name: Plugin
            config:
              some_key: value-1
              some_struct:
                another_key: value-2
```

We call this sequence of plugins a **plugin chain**. Plugins in a plugin chain will be executed in the order they are 
defined. The first plugin to deny the request will cause the chain execution to be interrupted and Gloo to return the 
response from the plugin that denied it. 

Each external auth plugin can append, add or override headers from the request it received before dispatching it to the 
upstream or the next plugin in the chain. It is important to understand how header modifications are handled when more 
than one plugin gets executed.

Let's look at the [response object](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/blob/master/api/interface.go#L15) 
returned by our `AuthService` instance:

{{< highlight go "hl_lines=7-10" >}}
package api

import (
	envoyauthv2 "github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane/envoy/service/auth/v2"
)

type AuthorizationResponse struct {
	UserInfo UserInfo
	CheckResponse envoyauthv2.CheckResponse
}
{{< /highlight >}}

You can see that it wraps the Envoy [CheckResponse](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/service/auth/v2/external_auth.proto#service-auth-v2-checkresponse) 
type. Gloo conforms to the Envoy API semantics when merging headers in plugin chains. If you go to the linked Envoy docs 
page and inspect the [OkHttpResponse](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/service/auth/v2/external_auth.proto#service-auth-v2-okhttpresponse) 
object, you will see that it consists of just an array of [HeadersValueOption objects](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/api/v2/core/base.proto#envoy-api-msg-core-headervalueoption).
A `HeadersValueOption` associates a header value with an `Append` flag. The flag determines whether the header will 
overridden or appended to the one in the request.

To give a concrete example, suppose Gloo receives a request that with the following header:

```text
Headers:
  - one: foo
```

and that the request matches a virtual host that is configured with the following plugin chain:

```     
Plugin_1:
  HeadersValueOptions:
  - Header:
      one: bar
    Append: false
Plugin_2:
  HeadersValueOptions:
  - Header:
      one: baz
    Append: true
  - Header:
      two: asd
```

If the request is authenticated by both plugins, then the headers on the final request that will be sent to the upstream 
will be:

```text
Headers:
  - one: bar, baz
  - two: asd
```

## Conclusion
If you got to this point, we hope that you have a good understanding of how the Gloo Ext Auth plugin framework works and 
that you are ready to start hacking away! If you have any questions or ideas about how to improve this guide, please 
contact us on our [**Slack**](https://slack.solo.io) or open an issue in our [docs repository](https://github.com/solo-io/solo-docs).
