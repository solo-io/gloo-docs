description: Installing Gloo into an existing Kubernetes cluster.

If this is your first time running Gloo, you’ll need to download the command-line interface (CLI) called `glooctl`
on to your local machine. You’ll use this CLI to interact with Gloo, including installing it onto your Kubernetes cluster.

### Options to Install Gloo

To install Gloo, you can use one of two options:

* [Install via the Command Line Interface (CLI) `glooctl` (recommended)](#install-gloo-via-command-line-interface-cli)
* [Install via Helm](#install-gloo-with-helm)

### Verify Installation

* [Verify installation](#verify-your-installation)

### Uninstall Gloo

* [Uninstall Gloo](#uninstall)

We highly recommend installing Gloo using the Gloo CLI as it simplifies a lot of the user experience of using Gloo.
For power users, feel free to use the underlying `yaml` configuration files directly.

These directions assume you've prepared your Kubernetes cluster appropriately. Full details on setting up your
Kubernetes cluster [here](../setup_kubernetes).

There are several options for deploying Gloo, depending on your use case and deployment platform.

* **Gateway**: (**recommended**) Gloo's full feature set is available via its v1/Gateway API. The Gateway API
is modeled on Envoy's API with the use of opinionated defaults to make complex configurations possible
while maintaining simplicity when required.

* **Ingress**: Gloo supports the Kubernetes Ingress resource, acting as a Kubernetes Ingress Controller.

{{% notice note %}}
ingress objects must have the annotation `"kubernetes.io/ingress.class": "gloo"` to be processed by the Gloo Ingress.
{{% /notice %}}

* **Knative**: Gloo integrates automatically with Knative as a cluster-level ingress for
[*Knative-Serving*](https://github.com/knative/serving). Gloo can be used in this way as a lightweight replacement
for Istio when using Knative-Serving.

## Install Gloo via Command Line Interface (CLI)

Choosing a deployment option for installing Gloo into your Kubernetes cluster:

* [Gateway](#install-the-gloo-gateway-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-using-glooctl) (**recommended**)
* [Ingress](#install-the-gloo-ingress-controller-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-using-glooctl)
* [Knative](http://localhost:1313/installation/kubernetes/quick_start/#install-the-gloo-knative-cluster-ingress-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-using-glooctl)

{{% notice info %}}
You can install Gloo to an existing namespace by providing the `-n` option, e.g. `glooctl install gateway -n my-namespace`.
If the option is not provided, the namespace defaults to `gloo-system`.
{{% /notice %}}

### Install the Gloo Gateway to your Kubernetes Cluster using `glooctl`

Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, run the following command to deploy the Gloo Gateway to the `gloo-system` namespace:

```bash
glooctl install gateway
```

After you [verify your installation](#verify-your-installation), please see [Getting Started on Kubernetes](../../../user_guides/basic_routing)
to get started using the Gloo Gateway.

### Install the Gloo Ingress Controller to your Kubernetes Cluster using `glooctl`

Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, run the following command to deploy the Gloo Ingress to the `gloo-system` namespace:

```bash
glooctl install ingress
```

After you [verify your installation](#verify-your-installation), please see [Getting Started with Kubernetes Ingress](../../../user_guides/basic_ingress)
to get started using the Gloo Ingress Controller.

### Install the Gloo Knative Cluster Ingress to your Kubernetes Cluster using `glooctl`

Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, run the following command to deploy Knative-Serving components to the
`knative-serving` namespace and Gloo to the `gloo-system` namespace:

```bash
glooctl install knative
```

After you [verify your installation](#verify-your-installation), please see [Getting Started with Gloo and Knative](../../../user_guides/gloo_with_knative)
to use Gloo as your Knative Ingress.

---

## Install Gloo with Helm

This is the recommended method for installing Gloo to your production environment as it offers rich customization to
the Gloo control plane and the proxies Gloo manages.

### Accessing the Gloo chart repository

As a first step, you have to add the Gloo repository to the list of known chart repositories:

```shell
helm repo add gloo https://storage.googleapis.com/solo-public-helm
```

You can then list all the charts in the repository by running the following command:

```shell
helm search gloo/gloo --versions
```

```noop
NAME         	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
gloo/gloo    	0.7.6        	           	Gloo Helm chart for Kubernetes
gloo/gloo    	0.7.5        	           	Gloo Helm chart for Kubernetes
gloo/gloo    	0.7.4        	           	Gloo Helm chart for Kubernetes
gloo/gloo    	0.7.1        	           	Gloo Helm chart for Kubernetes
gloo/gloo    	0.7.0        	           	Gloo Helm chart for Kubernetes
gloo/gloo    	0.6.24       	           	Gloo Helm chart for Kubernetes
gloo/gloo    	0.6.23       	           	Gloo Helm chart for Kubernetes
gloo/gloo    	0.6.22       	           	Gloo Helm chart for Kubernetes
gloo/gloo    	0.6.21       	           	Gloo Helm chart for Kubernetes
gloo/gloo    	0.6.20       	           	Gloo Helm chart for Kubernetes
...
```

### Choosing a deployment option

There are three deployment options for Gloo. The option to be installed is determined by the values that are passed
to the Gloo Helm chart.

* `gateway`
* `ingress`
* `knative`

#### Gateway

By default, the Gloo Helm chart is configured with the values for the `gateway` deployment. Hence, if you run:

```shell
helm install gloo/gloo --name gloo-0-7-6 --namespace my-namespace
```

Helm will install the `gateway` deployment of Gloo to the cluster your _KUBECONFIG_ is pointing to. Remember to specify
the two additional options, otherwise Helm will install Gloo to the `default` namespace and generate a funny release
`name` for it.

#### Ingress and Knative

The Gloo chart archive contains the necessary value files for each of the remaining deployment options. Run the
following command to download and extract the archive to the current directory:

```shell
helm fetch --untar=true --untardir=. gloo/gloo
```

You can then use either of the following to install the correspondent flavor of Gloo.

* `values-ingress.yaml`
* `values-knative.yaml`

For example, to install Gloo as your Knative Ingress you can run:

```shell
helm install gloo/gloo --name gloo-knative-0-7-6 --namespace my-namespace -f values-knative.yaml
```

After you've installed Gloo, please check out our [User Guides](../../../user_guides).

### Customizing your installation

You can customize the Gloo installation by providing your own value file.

For example, you can create a file named `value-overrides.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
rbac:
  create: false
settings:
  writeNamespace: my-custom-namespace
```

and use it to override default values in the Gloo Helm chart:

```shell
helm install gloo/gloo --name gloo-custom-0-7-6 --namespace my-namespace -f value-overrides.yaml
```

The install command accepts multiple value files, so if you want to override the default values for a `knative`
deployment you can run:

```shell
helm install gloo/gloo --name gloo-custom-knative-0-7-6 --namespace my-namespace -f values-knative.yaml -f value-overrides.yaml
```

The right-most file specified takes precedence (see the [Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/#helm-install) for more
info on the `install` command).

#### List of Gloo chart values

The table below describes all the values that you can override in your custom values file.

## Verify your Installation

Check that the Gloo pods and services have been created. Depending on your install option, you may see some differences
from the following example. And if you choose to install Gloo into a different namespace than the default `gloo-system`,
then you will need to query your chosen namespace instead.

```shell
kubectl get all -n gloo-system
```

## Uninstall {#uninstall}

To uninstall Gloo and all related components, simply run the following.

{{% notice note %}}
This will also remove Knative-Serving, if it was installed by `glooctl`.
{{% /notice %}}

```shell
glooctl uninstall
```

If you installed Gloo to a different namespace, you will have to specify that namespace using the `-n` option:

```shell
glooctl uninstall -n my-namespace
```

## Next Steps

After you've installed Gloo, please check out our [User Guides](../../../user_guides).
