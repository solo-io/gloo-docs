# Gloo Open-Source

Gloo Open-Source runs in 3 different modes to enable different use cases:

<dic markdown=1>
<table>
  <tr height="100">
    <td width="10%">
      <a href="gateway"><img src="../img/Gloo-01.png" width="60"/></a>
    </td>
    <td>
     Run Gloo in `gateway` mode to function as an API Gateway. This is the most fully-featured and customizable installation of Gloo, and is our <b>recommended install for first-time users</b>. The Gloo Gateway can be configured via Kubernetes Custom Resources, Consul Key-Value storage, or `.yaml` files on Gloo's local filesystem.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr height="100">
    <td width="10%">
      <a href="knative"><img src="../img/knative.png" width="60"/></a>
    </td>
    <td>
     Run Gloo in `knative` mode to serve as the Gateway/Ingress for Knative, configured automatically by [Knative Serving](https://github.com/knative/serving) to route to [Knative Services](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/spec/spec.md).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr height="100">
    <td width="10%">
      <a href="ingress"><img src="../img/ingress.png" width="60"/></a>
    </td>
    <td>Run Gloo in `ingress` mode to act as a standard Kubernetes Ingress controller. In this mode, Gloo will import
        its configuration from the `extensions/v1beta1.Ingress` Kubernetes resource. This can be used to achieve compatibility with the standard Kubernetes ingress API. Note that Gloo's Ingress API does not support customization via annotations. If you wish to extend Gloo beyond the functions of basic ingress, it is recommended to run Gloo in `gateway` mode.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

> Note: The installation modes are not mutually exclusive, e.g. if you wish to run `gateway` in conjunction with `ingress`, it can be done by installing both options to the same (or different) namespaces.

# Gloo Enterprise

Gloo Enterprise has a single installation workflow:

<dic markdown=1>
<table>
  <tr height="100">
    <td width="10%">
      <a href="enterprise"><img src="../img/gloo-ee.png" width="60"/></a>
    </td>
    <td>
    Gloo Enterprise is based on the open-source Gloo Gateway with additional (closed source) UI and plugins. See [the Gloo Enterprise documentation](https://solo.io/glooe) for more details on the additional features of the Enterprise version of Gloo.
