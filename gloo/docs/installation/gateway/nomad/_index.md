# Motivation

[HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) is a popular workload scheduler that can be used in place of, or in combination with Kubernetes as a way of running long-lived processes on a cluster of hosts. 

Nomad supports native integration with Consul and Vault, making configuration, service discovery, and credential management easy for application developers.

This guide shows how to run Gloo as an Ingress/Gateway for the Nomad platform, using Consul for service discovery/configuration and Vault for secret storage.


# Installing on Nomad

Installation on Nomad requires the following:

- [Levant](https://github.com/jrasell/levant) installed on your local machine
- [Docker](https://github.com/jrasell/levant), [Consul](https://www.consul.io), [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io), and [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) installed on the target host machine (which can also be your local machine)

> Note: This nomad job is experimental and designed to be used with a specific Vault + Consul + Nomad setup.

Inputs for the job can be tweaked by modifying `variables/variables-*.yaml` files

## Download the Installation Files

This tutorial uses files stored on the Gloo GitHub repository.

In order to install on Nomad, we'll want to clone the repository:

```
git clone --branch v0.18.23 https://github.com/solo-io/gloo
cd gloo/install/nomad
```

Installation files live in the `install/nomad` directory.

The Gloo [Nomad Job](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/index.html) lives at `install/nomad/jobs/gloo.nomad`
[Levant Variables](https://github.com/jrasell/levant) for the Gloo Nomad Job live at `install/nomad/variables/variables-{mac,linux}.yaml`

## Run the complete Demo

If your environment is set up with `docker`, `nomad`, `consul`, `vault`, and `levant`, you can simply run 
`demo.sh` to run a local demo of Gloo routing to the PetStore Nomad.

## Running Nomad, Consul and Vault

### Running Nomad Locally

If you've installed Nomad/Consul/Vault locally, you can use `launch-consul-vault-nomad-dev.sh` to run them on your local system.

If running locally (without Vagrant) on macOS, you will need to install the [Weave Net Docker Plugin](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/install/plugin/plugin-v2/):

```bash
docker swarm init # if your docker host is not currently a swarm manager
docker plugin install weaveworks/net-plugin:latest_release --grant-all-permissions
docker plugin enable weaveworks/net-plugin:latest_release
docker network create --driver=weaveworks/net-plugin:latest_release --attachable weave

```

If running locally on Linux, you'll need to disable SELinux in order to run the demo (or add permission for docker containers to access `/` on their filesystem):

```bash
sudo setenforce 0
```

### Running Nomad Using Vagrant 

The provided `Vagrantfile` will run Nomad, Consul, and Vault inside a VM on your local machine. Download and install [HashiCorp Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).

Then run the following command:

```bash
vagrant up
```

Ports will be forwarded to your local system, allowing you to access services on the following ports (on `localhost`):

|  service  | port | 
| ----- | ---- |  
| nomad | 4646 | 
| consul | 8500 | 
| vault | 8200 | 
| gloo/http | 8080 | 
| gloo/https | 8443 | 
| gloo/admin | 19000 | 

## Installing Gloo on Nomad (Linux)

```bash
levant deploy \
    -var-file variables/variables-linux.yaml \
    -address <nomad-host>:<nomad-port> \
    -consul-address <nomad-host>:<nomad-port> \
    jobs/gloo.nomad
```

If running locally or with `vagrant`, you can omit the `address` flags:

```bash
levant deploy \
    -var-file variables/variables-linux.yaml \
    jobs/gloo.nomad
```

## Installing Gloo on Nomad (Mac)

This option assumes you have Nomad, Consul, Vault, and Docker installed and running on your local macOS workstation.

```bash
levant deploy \
    -var-file variables/variables-mac.yaml \
    jobs/gloo.nomad
```

## Example

To run a test example, let's deploy the `petstore` application to Nomad as well:


### Deploy the PetStore on Nomad (Linux)

```bash
levant deploy \
    -var-file variables/variables-linux.yaml \
    -address <nomad-host>:<nomad-port> \
    -consul-address <nomad-host>:<nomad-port> \
    jobs/petstore.nomad
```

If running locally or with `vagrant`, you can omit the `address` flags:

```bash
levant deploy \
    -var-file variables/variables-linux.yaml \
    jobs/petstore.nomad
```

### Deploy the PetStore on Nomad (Mac)

This option assumes you have Nomad, Consul, Vault, and Docker installed and running on your local macOS workstation.

```bash
levant deploy \
    -var-file variables/variables-mac.yaml \
    jobs/petstore.nomad
```


### Create a Route to the PetStore

We can now use `glooctl` to create a route to the PetStore app we just deployed:

```bash
glooctl add route \
    --path-prefix / \
    --dest-name petstore \
    --prefix-rewrite /api/pets \
    --use-consul
```

```bash
{"level":"info","ts":"2019-08-22T17:15:24.117-0400","caller":"selectionutils/virtual_service.go:100","msg":"Created new default virtual service","virtualService":"virtual_host:<domains:\"*\" > status:<> metadata:<name:\"default\" namespace:\"gloo-system\" > "}
+-----------------+--------------+---------+------+---------+-----------------+--------------------------------+
| VIRTUAL SERVICE | DISPLAY NAME | DOMAINS | SSL  | STATUS  | LISTENERPLUGINS |             ROUTES             |
+-----------------+--------------+---------+------+---------+-----------------+--------------------------------+
| default         |              | *       | none | Pending |                 | / -> gloo-system.petstore      |
|                 |              |         |      |         |                 | (upstream)                     |
+-----------------+--------------+---------+------+---------+-----------------+--------------------------------+
```

> The `--use-consul` flag tells glooctl to write configuration to Consul Key-Value storage

And finally `curl` the Gateway Proxy:

```bash
curl <nomad-host>:8080/
```

If running on macOS or with Vagrant:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/
```

If running on Linux, use the Host IP on the `docker0` interface:

```bash
curl 172.17.0.1:8080/
```

```json
[{"id":1,"name":"Dog","status":"available"},{"id":2,"name":"Cat","status":"pending"}]
```

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed Gloo to Nomad and created your first route.

Most of the existing tutorials for Gloo can be reused with Nomad, however glooctl commands should be 
used with the `--use-consul` flag.
