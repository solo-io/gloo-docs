Gloo uses a [`VirtualService`]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gateway/api/v1/virtual_service.proto.sk" %}})
Custom Resource (CRD) to allow users to specify one or more [Route]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#route" %}})
rules to handle as a group. This guide will discuss how to matched routes act upon requests. Please refer to the
[Advanced Route Matching]({{% ref "/user_guides/gateway/configuring_route_options/advanced_routing" %}}) guide for more information on how to pattern match
requests in routes. These are examples of how to use the [Route Action]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#routeaction" %}}).

To give you some context, Gloo [Virtual Services]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gateway/api/v1/virtual_service.proto.sk#VirtualService" %}}) contain zero or more [Route]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#route" %}}) objects.
Each [Route]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#route" %}}) includes a
[Matcher]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#matcher" %}}) and a [Route Action]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#routeaction" %}}). The matcher provides conditional rules to select requests should be handled by a given
route, and the action defines how to handle or act upon a given request. This guide will primarily focus on the details
of configuring a [Route Action]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#routeaction" %}}).

You can use the glooctl command line to provide you a template manifest that you can start editing. The `--dry-run` option
tells glooctl to NOT actually create the custom resource and instead output the custom resource manifest. This is a
great way to get an initial manifest template that you can edit and then `kubectl apply` later. For example, the
[`glooctl add route`]({{% ref "/cli/glooctl_add_route" %}}) command will generate a `VirtualService` resource if it
does not already exist, and it will add a route spec like the following which shows forwarding all requests to `/petstore`
to the upstream `default-petstore-8080` in the `gloo-system` namespace.

```shell
glooctl add route --dry-run \
  --name default \
  --path-prefix /petstore \
  --dest-name default-petstore-8080 \
  --dest-namespace gloo-system
```

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=14-18" >}}
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: default
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - '*'
    routes:
    - matcher:
        prefix: /petstore
      routeAction:
        single:
          upstream:
            name: default-petstore-8080
            namespace: gloo-system
status: {}
{{< /highlight >}}

A route action contains one and only one of the following three options:

* [`single`](#single): forward request to a [single destination]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#destination" %}})
* [`multi`](#multi): forward request to a group of one or more destination ([MultiDestination]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#multidestination" %}})) based on a percentage weight associated with each destination
* [`upstream_group`](#upstream_group): similar to a MultiDestination that can be shared across multiple routes and virtual services

### Single Destination {#single}

The [Destination]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#destination" %}}) has a
required `upstream` [ResourceRef]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/v1/ref.proto.sk#resourceref" %}}), an
optional `destinationSpec` [DestinationSpec]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/plugins.proto.sk#destinationspec" %}}),
and an optional `subset` [Subset]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/subset.proto.sk#subset" %}}).
The `upstream` defines the name and namespace of the upstream to which the request should be routed. The `destinationSpec`
is an optional plugin definition based on the upstream, e.g., forwarding a request to an AWS Lambda function may require
additional information on how to transform the request. The `subset` is a way to define a selector such that the request
will be routed to a defined subset of all the request handlers (e.g., pods) in an upstream. Let's look at some examples.

To forward all requests that match a route matcher, you can provide the upstream definition like in the following
manifest snippet from the previous example.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=5-8" >}}
routes:
- matcher:
    prefix: /petstore
  routeAction:
    single:
      upstream:
        name: default-petstore-8080
        namespace: gloo-system
{{< /highlight >}}

To forward all requests to a REST function within an upstream, you would provide an additional rest `desinationSpec` like
as follows.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=6-11" >}}
routes:
- matcher:
    prefix: /petstore/findPetById
  routeAction:
    single:
      destinationSpec:
        rest:
          functionName: findPetById
          parameters:
            headers:
              :path: /petstore/findPetById/{id}
      upstream:
        name: default-petstore-8080
        namespace: gloo-system
{{< /highlight >}}

This previous would be like execution the following glooctl command:

```shell
glooctl add route \
  --name default \
  --path-prefix /petstore/findPetById \
  --dest-name default-petstore-8080 \
  --dest-namespace gloo-system \
  --rest-function-name findPetById \
  --rest-parameters ':path=/petstore/findPetById/{id}'
```

#### Subset

[Subset]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/subset.proto.sk#subset" %}}) currently lets you
provide a Kubernetes selector to allow request forwarding to a subset of Kubernetes Pods within the upstream associated
Kubernetes Service. There are currently two steps required to get subsetting to work for Kubernetes upstreams, which are
the only upstream type currently supported. First, you need to edit the upstream manifest and add a
[`subsetSpec`]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/plugins/subset_spec.proto.sk#subsetspec" %}})
within the [Kubernetes Upstream Spec]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/plugins/kubernetes/kubernetes.proto.sk" %}}).
Second, you need to add a [`subset`]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/subset.proto.sk#subset" %}})
within the [`Destination` spec]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#destination" %}})
of the Route Action.

Following is an example of using a label, e.g., `color: blue`, to subset pods handling requests.

Upstream changes that allow you to use the label `color` as a subset selector

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=15-18" >}}
apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
  kind: Upstream
    labels:
      discovered_by: kubernetesplugin
      service: petstore
    name: default-petstore-8080
    namespace: gloo-system
  spec:
    upstreamSpec:
      kube:
        selector:
          app: petstore
        serviceName: petstore
        serviceNamespace: default
        subsetSpec:
          selectors:
          - keys:
            - color
        servicePort: 8080
        serviceSpec:
          rest:
...
{{< /highlight >}}

And then you need to configure the subset within the Virtual Service route action, e.g., the following will only forward
requests to a subset of the Petstore Service pods that have a label, `color: blue`.

{{% notice note %}}
If no pods match the selector, i.e., empty set, then the route action will fall back to forwarding the request to all
pods served by that upstream.
{{% /notice %}}

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=22-24" >}}
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
  kind: VirtualService
  metadata:
    name: default
    namespace: gloo-system
  spec:
    virtualHost:
      domains:
      - '*'
      name: gloo-system.default
      routes:
      - matcher:
          prefix: /petstore/findPetById
        routeAction:
          single:
            destinationSpec:
              rest:
                functionName: findPetById
                parameters:
                  headers:
                    :path: /petstore/findPetById/{id}
            subset:
              values:
              - color: blue
            upstream:
              name: default-petstore-8080
              namespace: gloo-system
{{< /highlight >}}

### Multiple Destination {#multi}

The [MultiDestination]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#multidestination" %}})
has an array of one or more [WeightedDestination]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#weighteddestination" %}})
specs that are a single destination plus a `weight`. The weight is the percentage of request traffic forwarded to that
destination where the percentage is: `weight` divided by sum of all weights in `MultiDestination`.

Here's an example to help make this more concrete. Assuming we've got two versions of a service - `default-myservice-v1-8080`
and `default-myservice-v2-8080` - and we want to route 10% of request traffic to `default-myservice-v2-8080` as part of a
Canary deploy, i.e., route a small portion of traffic to a new version to make sure new version works in the service before
decommissioning the original version. Here's what a route would look like with 90% of traffic going to v1 and 10% to v2.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=5-16" >}}
routes:
- matcher:
    prefix: /myservice
  routeAction:
    multi:
      destinations:
      - weight: 9
        destination:
          upstream:
            name: default-myservice-v1-8080
            namespace: gloo-system
      - weight: 1
        destination:
          upstream:
            name: default-myservice-v2-8080
            namespace: gloo-system
{{< /highlight >}}

### Upstream Group {#upstream_group}

An [UpstreamGroup]({{% ref "/v1/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk#upstreamgroup" %}}) addresses
an issue of how do you have multiple routes or virtual services referencing the same multiple weighted destinations where
you want to change the weighting consistently for all calling routes. This is a common need for Canary deployments
where you want all calling routes to forward traffic consistently across the two service versions.

For example, if I'm doing a Canary deployment of a new shopping cart service, I may want my inventory and ordering services
to call the same weighted destinations consistently, AND I want the ability to update the destination weights, e.g. go
from 90% v3 and 10% v4 => 50% v3 and 50% v4 **without** needing to know what routes are referencing my upstream destinations.

![Upstream Group example](/img/inv2.png)

There are two steps to using an upstream group. First, you need to create an Upstream Group custom resource, and then you
need to reference that Upstream Group from your one or more route actions. Let's build on our [Multiple Destination](#multi)
example.

#### Create Upstream Group

{{< highlight yaml >}}
apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: UpstreamGroup
metadata:
  name: my-service-group
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  destinations:
  - destination:
      upstream:
        name: default-myservice-v1-8080
        namespace: gloo-system
    weight: 9
  - destination:
      upstream:
        name: default-myservice-v2-8080
        namespace: gloo-system
    weight: 1
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Reference Upstream Group in your Route Actions

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=5-8 12-15" >}}
routes:
- matcher:
    prefix: /myservice
  routeAction:
    upstreamGroup:
      name: my-service-group
      namespace: gloo-system
- matcher:
    prefix: /some/other/path
  routeAction:
    upstreamGroup:
      name: my-service-group
      namespace: gloo-system
{{< /highlight >}}

Once deployed, you can update the weights in your shared Upstream Group and those changes will be picked up by all routes
that referencing that upstream group instance.
