### v0.12.0

**Dependency Bumps**

- solo-io/solo-kit has been upgraded to v0.3.10.

**Breaking Changes**

- Remove the shorthand params for glooctl proxy url --name (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/577)
- Make sure namespace (and name, where applicable) are added as top-level options, to improve the docs.
This is breaking because now extensions to the CLI need to make sure they don't try to add namespace
if it is already provided by the top-level command. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/582)

**New Features**

- Add flag to turn off CRD creation during installation with Helm. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/433)
- `glooctl uninstall` by default only deletes gloo services, deployments, and config maps. It no longer removes the
installation namespace by default. Several additional options are available: `--delete-crds` will also remove
gloo custom resource definitions, and any associated objects (virtual services, etc). `--delete-namespace` will
remove the namespace and anything inside it. `--all` will delete the namespace, CRDs, and any gloo cluster
roles or cluster role bindings. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/433)

- Add sds support for upstreams to allow integration with istio (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/510)

**Fixes**

- Only consider gateways in the write namespace, so installations in different namespaces with overlapping discovery won't fail to set up the proxy. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/538)
- Change name of cluster role binding created during Gloo installation to include namespace, so that writing it doesn't remove the cluster role binding for other Gloo installations. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/540)
- Give the gloo cluster role the union of permissions necessary for gateway, ingress, and knative modes, to support installing multiple modes of Gloo on a single cluster. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/544)
- Make cluster role and cluster role bindings granular per type of gloo installation. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/544)
