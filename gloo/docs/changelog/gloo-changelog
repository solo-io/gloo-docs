**New Features**

- allow disabling fds on a per-namespace and per-service basis (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/679)

**Fixes**

- When the translation of the Gloo API snapshot to the xDS one returns an error we currently skip updating the xDS cache. Gloo attempts to remove errored upstreams without compromising the consistency of the snapshot, but most errors still result in the xDS cache not being updated. By not updating the cache, Envoy will continue using the previous snapshot, which we assume to be valid. The problem with this approach is that endpoints are relatively ephemeral entities (think Kubernetes pods) and the snapshot that Gloo is using might become stale if any endpoint changes. With this fix Gloo will try to update the EDS information in the xDS cache even if an error occurred during translation. It does so by retrieving the previous xDS snapshot, updating only the EDS information, verifying the consistency of the resulting snapshot, and, if consistent, persisting it in the cache. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/657)
- Fix race condition where helm chart sometimes wouldn't publish on release builds. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/785)

**Breaking Changes**

remove the namespace and anything inside it. `--all` will delete the namespace, CRDs, and any gloo cluster
roles or cluster role bindings. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/433)

- Add sds support for upstreams to allow integration with istio (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/510)

**Fixes**

- Only consider gateways in the write namespace, so installations in different namespaces with overlapping discovery won't fail to set up the proxy. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/538)
- Change name of cluster role binding created during Gloo installation to include namespace, so that writing it doesn't remove the cluster role binding for other Gloo installations. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/540)
- Give the gloo cluster role the union of permissions necessary for gateway, ingress, and knative modes, to support installing multiple modes of Gloo on a single cluster. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/544)
- Make cluster role and cluster role bindings granular per type of gloo installation. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/544)
