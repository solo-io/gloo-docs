## glooctl proxy address

print the socket address for a proxy

### Synopsis

Use this command to view the address (host:port) of a Proxy reachable from outside the cluster. You can connect to this address from a host on the same network (such as the host machine, in the case of minikube/minishift).

```

```

### Options

```
  -h, --help            help for address
  -l, --local-cluster   use when the target kubernetes cluster is running locally, e.g. in minikube or minishift. this will default to true if LoadBalanced services are not assigned external IPs by your cluster
```
