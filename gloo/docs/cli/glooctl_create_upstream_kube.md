## glooctl create upstream kube

Create a Kubernetes Upstream

### Synopsis

Kubernetes Upstreams represent a collection of endpoints for Services registered with Kubernetes. Typically, Gloo will automatically discover these upstreams, meaning you don't have to create them. However, if upstream discovery in Gloo is disabled, or RBAC permissions have not been granted to Gloo to read from the registry, Kubernetes services can be added to Gloo manually via the CLI.

```
glooctl create upstream kube [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                            help for kube
      --kube-service string             name of the kubernetes service
      --kube-service-labels strings     comma-separated list of labels (key=value) to use for customized selection of pods for this upstream. can be used to select subsets of pods for a service e.g. for blue-green deployment
      --kube-service-namespace string   namespace where the kubernetes service lives (default "default")
      --kube-service-port uint32        the port exposed by the kubernetes service. for services with multiple ports, create an upstream for each port. (default 80)
      --service-spec-type string        if set, Gloo supports additional routing features to upstreams with a service spec. The service spec defines a set of features 
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --dry-run            print kubernetes-formatted yaml rather than creating or updating a resource
  -i, --interactive        use interactive mode
      --name string        name of the resource to read or write
  -n, --namespace string   namespace for reading or writing resources (default "gloo-system")
  -o, --output string      output format: (yaml, json, table)
      --yaml               print basic (non-kubernetes) yaml rather than creating or updating a resource
