## glooctl create upstreamgroup

Create an Upstream Group

### Synopsis

Upstream groups represent groups of upstreams. An UpstreamGroup addresses an issue of how do you have multiple routes or virtual services referencing the same multiple weighted destinations where you want to change the weighting consistently for all calling routes. This is a common need for Canary deployments where you want all calling routes to forward traffic consistently across the two service versions.

```
glooctl create upstreamgroup [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                         help for upstreamgroup
      --weighted-upstreams strings   comma-separated list of weighted upstream key=value entries (namespace.upstreamName=weight)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

  -i, --interactive         use interactive mode

  -n, --namespace string    namespace for reading or writing resources (default "gloo-system")

```
